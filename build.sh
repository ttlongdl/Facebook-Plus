# Builds Facebook Plus for every packaging scheme and writes one versioned .deb
# per scheme to packages/:
#
#   packages/Facebook-Plus-v<version>-rootless.deb
#   packages/Facebook-Plus-v<version>-rootfull.deb
#
# If a decrypted Facebook IPA is present at test/com.facebook.Facebook.ipa, the
# rootless build is then injected into it with cyan and written as
# packages/Facebook-Plus-v<facebook-version>-rootless.ipa, where the version is
# read from the IPA's own Info.plist. Any custom app-icon logos under
# resources/logo/ (fbplus_*.png) are injected in the same cyan run: their files go
# to the .app root and their CFBundleAlternateIcons entries are merged into the
# app's Info.plist (Facebook's own icons preserved).
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                          # build every scheme
#   SCHEMES="rootless" ./build.sh       # build a subset
#
# Requires: theos ($THEOS, defaults to ~/theos). cyan is needed only for the
#   optional IPA injection step.
